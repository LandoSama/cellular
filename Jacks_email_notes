jack's notes from e-mail

So heres some notes on what I would like to see in a dumbed down 0.1 engine.

N cells spawn at random x,y coords

Each cell is a circle with radius 1

food is randomly dropped in at a given rate to random locations

cells move towards food if close enough else they just travel, turning a certain amount after a random distance

cells increase their size and make new organelles by buying them with energy and materials

food is digested in a raction that produces energy and materials

when the radius of a cell hits 2.0, it stops growing and divides into two cells of radius 1 or something

starting organelles could just be a nucleus, a cell membrane, a digester to convert food into materials and energy, and a ribosomeish contructor to make new organelles

cells should move and accellerate based on their radius and friction in the enviornment

just touching food could make them eat it

After this there are a few differnt directions I could see us distributing among various groups:

Increasing the complexity of food and metabolism

Graphical output

Cell ai

Genetics and evolution

Complexifying interal cell systems

adding new types of cells like plants and predators

cell aging and death

enviornmental factors

logging and data visualzation
